You are a peaceful citizen who happens to own a gun. Some trees have become sentient, and evil. They are slowly taking over the world, and you are our last line of defense. 
But some trees are good, and we don’t want to kill them. We can tell good trees from bad trees because bad trees can move and shoot, while good trees can’t do either.
Kill enough enemy trees to win the game.
Be careful, they will shoot back!

CONTROLS:
- WASD to move
- Space to jump 
- Left mouse to fire (align the crosshair with the target)

TO WIN:
Shoot enemy trees to earn points. Shooting good trees will result in a point deduction. Avoid enemy trees' bullets.
Both types of trees will spawn periodically in random places. Enemy trees can move and shoot you back. Good trees won't move nor hurt you.
There are 2 types of powerups: one that speeds up your movement, and one that gives you a life. Walk through these to collect them.
You complete the level when you shoot all enemy trees in the level. Once you complete a level, the next level will load (5 levels total). 
Once you complete the 5th level, you win!

TO LOSE:
You have a set number of lives (5). 
Enemy trees shoot you. If you get hit, you lose a life.
Lose all lives = lose the game
